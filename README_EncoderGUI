# Encoder GUI README

## Overview
This project implements a MATLAB GUI that visualises wheel encoder data to estimate distance travelled and robot direction by comparing the left and right wheel's distance traveled
The goal was to make raw encoder data easier to understand

## Why
- Raw encoder counts dont give much insight on their own as to what the robot is actually doing
- Using the encoder counts to calculate the distance and direction allows you to visualise what the robot is actually doing and record useful data about its movements

## Hardware
- ESP32 microcontroller
- 1 encoder connected to each rear wheel

## What Is The Encoder Counting?
- The Encoder counts how many pulses/clicks the wheel does
- Each pulse moves the car forward by around 2mm
- As the wheel rotates the count increases, each slight rotation is a pulse

## Encoder Count to Distance?
- To convert the counts to a distance in meteres in my code I multiplied the distance for one pulse 2mm by 0.001 to get to metres
- Then I multiply this value by the encoder count to get the total distance travelled for that wheel

## Direction Estimation
- To turn right the left wheel must move more than the right wheel and vice versa
- Using this knowledge i created a direction threshold variable of 10cm
- This variable indicated the minimum distance between the 2 wheels that would indicate a rotating motion is taking place
- If that direction threshold was reached my robot is turning and id set the direction in the code

## GUI Features
- Real time display of wheel distance travelled
- direction gauge visualisation
- Live plots of encoder data

## Limitations
- Relies only on encoder data so direction angle is innaccurate
- Encoder count must be reset each time code runs

## What I learned
- First time using MATLAB
- Improved understanding of wheel encoders

## Improvements to make
- More accurate distance calculation
- Include servo angle data in gui instead of estimating using encoder
- Calculate speed
